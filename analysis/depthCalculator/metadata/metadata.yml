description: "SFD_depth_calculator.m determines spatial frequency domain (SFD) penetration
  depth estimates using a scaled lookup table.  The table is  populated with results
  from Monte Carlo simulations at incremental mus&#39;/mua and spatial frequency (fx)
  values. \n\nInputs:\nmus&#39; = reduced scattering coefficient [/mm] of the tissue
  of interest\nmua  = absorption coefficient [/mm] of the tissue of interest\nfxs
  \ = spatial frequencies of interest\n\nOutputs:\ndepths = 2D matrix of penetration
  depth estimates, size [5, length(fxs)]\n         where first index is X (definition
  below) with values [10 25 50 75 90]\n\nThe penetration depth estimates are determined
  by calculating the maximum visitation depths of detected photons.  This forms a
  function P_zmax that when integrated with respect to z to a depth d produces \n
  \ P_zmax(z&lt;=d) = int_0^d P_zmax(z)dz.\nIf d=positive infinity, then the integration
  results in total diffuse reflectance, Rd.  Division of P_zmax by Rd\n  X = P_zmax(z&lt;=d)
  / Rd\nprovides the fraction (X) of the detected light that visited tissue depths
  d or less. Details are in accompanying manuscript."
