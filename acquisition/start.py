#### edit1: new naming scheme ####

name_xyz.bmp

x: wavelength (0 to n.Wavelengths)
y: spatial frequency (0 to nFreq)
z: phase (0 to nPhase)

#### edit2: reorder spatial frequencies in name ####

The original name convention had them ordered by spatial period (0, 10mm, 20mm, 30mm...)
The new naming convention has that reversed (except from 0), so they are ordered
by spatial frequency (0, 1/30, 1/20, 1/10...)

#### edit3: reorganized the acquisition procedure ####

Now captured images are kept in memory and saved at the end, in order to
speed up acquisition time

#### edit4: changed output path structure ####

Each full acquisition dataset is saved inside a folder named with a timestamp,
this way multiple time-points can be processed easily.
